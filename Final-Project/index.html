    <p>Before you will know about whom is this page, let me ask you a question:</p>
    <h3>Who is the most important person in our lives?</h3>

            <li><b>...</b> knows everything about us?</li>
            <li><b>...</b> stays with us in sorrow and joy?</li>
            <li><b>...</b> experiences all illnesses with us?</li>
            <li><b>...</b> can tell all our thoughts?</li>

      <p>And I think the simplest, but not the most obvious answer, is you and I!
        <br>
        Yes, perhaps we are ordinary people. And maybe not everyone can boast of great achievements.<br>
        But I argue that each of us is the most important, valuable, and significant person.<br>
        Of course, we are all surrounded by loved ones, parents, children, friends, who are undoubtedly important to us and in certain situations can become much more important than we are.<br>
        Other people can also be important to us, influencing our lives; we can be inspired by their actions or use their knowledge and wisdom to improve our lives.<br>
        But still, I continue to assert that being within ourselves, we ourselves have paramount importance and value.<br>
        And I also want to say that people who want to learn new things, grow, and explore new horizons make no less discoveries, put in no less effort, and deserve no less admiration than those known to the whole world.
